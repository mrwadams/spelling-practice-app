# Spelling Practice App

Welcome to the Spelling Practice App! This interactive web app is designed to help young students practise their spelling skills in a fun and engaging way. Created with Python and Streamlit, it focuses on the Common Exception Words, a list of words that children are expected to know how to spell by the end of each school year.

## Features

- Multiple word lists to choose from, tailored to different year groups.
- Interactive spelling practise session where the app reads a word and the child types in the spelling.
- Instant feedback on each spelling with audio cues for correct and incorrect answers.
- Ability to view the full list of words for each year group.
- Scoring system to track progress.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Word List:** Start by selecting a word list from the sidebar menu. The lists are tailored to different year groups, so you can choose the one that suits your child's level.

2. **Select a Page:** You have two options: "Practise Spellings" and "View Word List".
   - In "Practise Spellings", your child can listen to a word's pronunciation by clicking the "Hear Word" button, then type in the spelling. Click "Check Answer" to submit the spelling and get instant feedback.
   - In "View Word List", you can see the full list of words for the selected year group.

3. **Track Progress:** The app keeps score during each practise session, encouraging your child to improve their spelling skills.
